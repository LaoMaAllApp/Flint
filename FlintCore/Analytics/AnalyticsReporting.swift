/// This class observes action execution and passes the analytics data to your analytics subsystem for any Actions that
/// support analytics.
///
/// This allows internal or third party frameworks that use Flint to expose functionality that you also track with analytics,
/// without them directly linking to the analytics package.
///
/// To use Analytics reporting, you need to make sure AnalyticsFeature.isEnabled is set to true,
/// and you need to set an implementation of `AnalyticsProvider` to the `AnalyticsFeature.provider` property before Flint
/// `setup` is called. By default this includes just a default console analytics provider.
///
/// ```
/// AnalyticsFeature.provider = MyGoogleAnalyticsProvider()
/// ```
///
/// - see: `AnalyticsProvider` for the protocol to conform to, to wire up your actual analytics service such as Mixpanel,
/// Google Analytics or preferably, your own back end.
