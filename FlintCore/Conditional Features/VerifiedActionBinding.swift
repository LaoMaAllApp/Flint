/// A type used to prevent direct execution of actions on `ConditionalFeature`(s), such that
/// `ActionSession` only has functions to perform actions using `VerifiedActionBinding` and not
/// a `perform()` using a `ConditionalActionBinding`.
///
/// This makes it impossible to directly perform an action of a conditional feature without first requesting access to it,
/// as these request instances are only created by the framework and must be used to perform such actions.
///
/// The protocol extensions on `ConditionalFeature` only supports
/// `request` and not `perform`, forcing the caller to test if the feature is available first and at least
/// explicitly ignore the "feature not available" path, but hopefully provide a code path for that.
