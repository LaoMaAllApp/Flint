/// This type represents information about a product that can be purchased in your app, for use in
/// constraining features to specific products. This is not intended to implement a store client for displaying
/// products and purchasing, but you may extend the types to do this.
///
/// This is used by the `purchase` conditional feature constraint, allowing you to bind
/// Features to one or more Product, so that if the product is purchased, a group of features can
/// become available.
///
/// - see: `FeatureAvailability` and `PurchaseRequirement`
///
/// - note: The name and description are primarily used for local debugging. You can use them for your purchase UI
/// in your app but you will need to consider loading the strings for display from a strings bundle using
/// the value of `name` and `description` as keys. For StoreKit usage, you need to retrieve the localized
/// price from the App Store. You could do this with a subclass that lazily loads the prices when required.
///
/// - note: We use class semantics here so that the app can subclass it to include additional properties as required
/// for the purchasing mechanism they use.
