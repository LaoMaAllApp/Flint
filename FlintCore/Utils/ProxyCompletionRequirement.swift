/// to an existing completion instance, and then return a possibly modified result value to the original requirement.

/// Normally you need to know if completion you are wrapping would be called async or not, as you would need to
/// capture the async completion status before defining your completion block so it can call `completed` on the async result.
///
/// This is a bit nasty in the nuance of the implementation. We may remove this if `addProxyCompletionHandler`
